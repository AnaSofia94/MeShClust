Linux/Unix compilation:
make

Usage: bin/meshclust *.fasta [--id 0.90] [--kmer 3] [--delta 5] [--output output.clstr] [--iterations 20]

The most important parameter, --id, controls the identity of the sequences.

--kmer decides the size of the kmers. Increasing kmer size can increase accuracy, but increases memory consumption fourfold.

--delta decides how many clusters are looked around in the final clustering stage, increasing it creates more accuracy, but takes more time.

--output specifies the output file, in CD-HIT's CLSTR format

--iterations specifies how many iterations in the final stage of merging are done until convergence.
